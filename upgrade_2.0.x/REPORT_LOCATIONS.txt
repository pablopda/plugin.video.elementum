KEY FINDINGS:
- 7 CRITICAL memory management issues
- 95%+ crash probability under concurrent load
- 4 required fixes (4-6 hours total effort)
- NOT PRODUCTION READY

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Span pointer escapes lock (CRITICAL)
2. free_disk_buffer is empty (HIGH)
3. Global pointer to destroyed object (CRITICAL)
4. Storage index reuse with pending ops (HIGH)
5. Vector reallocation invalidates pointers (CRITICAL)
6. const_cast hides ownership (HIGH)
7. Lambda captures across thread boundary (CRITICAL)

RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT DEPLOY
All fixes must be implemented and tested before production.
